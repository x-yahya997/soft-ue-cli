Built and maintained by a solo developer. [Support this project](#support-this-project) if it saves you time.


**Control Unreal Engine 5 from your AI agent or terminal.** soft-ue-cli gives any LLM — via **MCP server** or **CLI** — 60+ tools to spawn actors, edit Blueprints, inspect materials, read and patch UE config files, run Play-In-Editor sessions, capture screenshots, profile performance, and more inside a running UE5 editor or packaged build.

Two connection paths. Same package. Bridge tools when Unreal is running, offline tools when it is not.


```text
LLM client / shell / CI
    |
    v
soft-ue-cli  (CLI or MCP server)
    |
    +-- Live bridge path ----------------------------------------------+
    |      HTTP / JSON-RPC
    |      -> SoftUEBridge plugin inside UE editor / PIE / dev build
    |      -> Actor, Blueprint, material, widget, PIE, profiling tools
    |
    +-- Offline local path --------------------------------------------+
           Direct local parsing
           -> .uasset / .uexp / .ini / .uproject / BuildConfiguration.xml
           -> inspect-uasset, diff-uasset, config tree/get/diff/audit, skills
```

## Why soft-ue-cli?

- **MCP server + CLI in one package** -- use as an MCP server (`mcp-serve`) for Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, and other MCP clients, **or** as a standard CLI for Claude Code, shell scripts, and CI/CD. Same 60+ tools either way.
- **AI-native UE automation** -- purpose-built so LLM agents can read, modify, and test Unreal Engine projects without a human touching the editor.
- **60+ tools** covering actors, Blueprints, materials, StateTrees, widgets, assets, config files, PIE sessions, profiling, and more.
- **Online + offline workflows** -- bridge-backed UE mutation and runtime inspection when Unreal is open, plus direct local inspection, diff, and config tooling when it is not.
- **Config-aware workflows** — inspect hierarchy, trace overrides, diff layers, and patch `.ini`, `BuildConfiguration.xml`, and `.uproject` data from one `config` command group.
- **LLM skill prompts** -- ships with markdown workflows (e.g. Blueprint-to-C++ conversion) exposed as MCP prompts or CLI commands.
- **Works everywhere UE runs** -- editor, cooked builds, Windows, macOS, Linux.
- **Single dependency** -- only requires `httpx`. Add `[mcp]` extra for MCP server mode.
- **Team-friendly** -- conditional compilation via `SOFT_UE_BRIDGE` environment variable means only developers who need the bridge get it compiled in.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
pip install soft-ue-cli          # CLI only
pip install soft-ue-cli[mcp]     # CLI + MCP server
```

### 2. Install the plugin into your UE project

Run the setup command **inside your LLM client** (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) — it outputs step-by-step instructions that the AI agent will follow to copy the plugin, edit your `.uproject`, and configure itself:

```bash
soft-ue-cli setup /path/to/YourProject
```

If you're running manually (not via an LLM), follow the printed instructions yourself: copy the plugin directory, add the `"Plugins"` entry to your `.uproject`, and create the `CLAUDE.md` snippet.

### 3. Rebuild and launch Unreal Engine

After regenerating project files and rebuilding, launch the editor. Look for this log line to confirm the bridge is running:

```
LogSoftUEBridge: Bridge server started on port 8080
```

### 5. Verify the connection

```bash
soft-ue-cli check-setup
```

You should see all checks pass:

```
[OK]   Plugin files found.
[OK]   SoftUEBridge enabled in YourGame.uproject.
[OK]   Bridge server reachable.
```

### 5. (Optional) Connect your MCP client

Add to your MCP client config (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "soft-ue-cli": {
      "command": "soft-ue-cli",
      "args": ["mcp-serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

The AI editor now has direct access to all 60+ UE tools and skill prompts — no terminal needed.

## How It Works

```text
soft-ue-cli command
    |
    +-- Bridge-backed commands ----------------------------------------+
    |      HTTP / JSON-RPC
    |      -> SoftUEBridge plugin (UGameInstanceSubsystem inside UE)
    |      -> UE APIs on the game thread
    |      -> Runtime/editor operations such as spawn-actor, PIE, query-level
    |
    +-- Offline commands ----------------------------------------------+
           Local parsers and file readers
           -> Package tables / tagged properties / config hierarchy
           -> inspect-uasset, diff-uasset, config *, skills get/list
```

The **SoftUEBridge** plugin is a lightweight C++ `UGameInstanceSubsystem` that starts an embedded HTTP server on port 8080 when UE launches. Bridge-backed commands send JSON-RPC requests to this server, and the plugin executes the corresponding UE operations on the game thread, returning structured JSON responses. Offline commands bypass the bridge entirely and operate directly on local files.

All commands output JSON to stdout (except `get-logs --raw`). Exit code 0 means success, 1 means error.

### Skills Architecture

```
LLM client (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)
    |
    |  soft-ue-cli skills get <name>
    v
Skill file  (markdown shipped with CLI pip package)
    |
    |  LLM reads instructions, type mappings, pre-filled commands
    v
LLM executes soft-ue-cli commands (query-blueprint, query-blueprint-graph, ...)
    |
    v
LLM generates output (e.g. .h/.cpp files) following the skill's rules
```

Skills are **markdown files** at `cli/soft_ue_cli/skills/*.md`, shipped as package data in the pip distribution. Each skill is self-contained: workflow instructions, reference tables, example CLI commands, and verification test cases. The CLI discovers them via `skills list` / `skills get`. When running as an MCP server, the same files are exposed via the `prompts/list` and `prompts/get` protocol.

### Test Workflow

Use soft-ue-cli to explore and debug a gameplay bug quickly, then move the final regression into the project's C++ Automation Spec suite.

```text
CLI + bridge + Python exploration
    -> find the signal
    -> validate the repro
    -> identify the exact assertion
    -> write the committed C++ Automation Spec in the project test module
```

The CLI is the exploration layer. The committed regression gate should live in project-native C++ tests rather than depending on the CLI, bridge, or Python runtime.

### MCP Server Architecture

```
MCP Client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)
    |
    |  stdio (JSON-RPC, MCP protocol)
    v
soft-ue-cli mcp-serve  (FastMCP server)
    |
    |  Reuses call_tool() — HTTP/JSON-RPC
    v
SoftUEBridge plugin (inside UE)
```

Running `soft-ue-cli mcp-serve` starts an MCP server over stdio. It auto-generates MCP tool schemas from the CLI's argparse parser and forwards tool calls to the UE bridge. Skills are exposed as MCP prompts. Install the optional extra: `pip install soft-ue-cli[mcp]`.

#   soft-ue-cli query-enum /Game/Data/E_Dependency
#   soft-ue-cli query-struct /Game/Data/S_Dependency
#   soft-ue-cli query-blueprint /Game/BP_Player --include all --include-inherited

# ...and generates the .h/.cpp files from the JSON responses
```

### Populate a level from a reference image

```bash
# Get the level-from-image skill instructions
soft-ue-cli skills get level-from-image
# The LLM analyzes the image, searches for matching assets, places them,
# then enters a visual feedback loop:
#   soft-ue-cli set-viewport-camera --preset top --ortho-width 8000
#   soft-ue-cli capture-viewport --source editor --output file
# Compares screenshot to reference, auto-corrects, then asks for human feedback
```

# Install with MCP support
pip install soft-ue-cli[mcp]

# Run the MCP server (used in MCP client config, not run manually)
soft-ue-cli mcp-serve
```

Add to your MCP client config (e.g. `claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "soft-ue-cli": {
      "command": "soft-ue-cli",
      "args": ["mcp-serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SOFT_UE_BRIDGE_URL` | *(none)* | Full bridge URL override (e.g. `http://192.168.1.10:8080`) |
| `SOFT_UE_BRIDGE_PORT` | `8080` | Port override when using localhost |
| `SOFT_UE_BRIDGE` | *(none)* | Set to `1` to enable conditional compilation in `Target.cs` |

### Server Discovery Order

The CLI finds the bridge server using this priority:

1. `--server` command-line flag
2. `SOFT_UE_BRIDGE_URL` environment variable
3. `SOFT_UE_BRIDGE_PORT` environment variable (constructs `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`)
4. `.soft-ue-bridge/instance.json` file (searched upward from the current working directory -- written automatically by the plugin at startup)
5. `http://127.0.0.1:8080` (default fallback)

### Conditional Compilation for Teams

If you want only specific developers to compile the bridge plugin (to avoid any overhead for artists or designers), use the `SOFT_UE_BRIDGE` environment variable in your `Target.cs`:

```csharp
// MyGameEditor.Target.cs
if (Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("SOFT_UE_BRIDGE") == "1")
{
    ExtraModuleNames.Add("SoftUEBridge");
}
```

Developers who need the bridge set `SOFT_UE_BRIDGE=1` in their environment. Everyone else builds without it.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is soft-ue-cli?

soft-ue-cli is a Python tool that gives AI agents and developers 60+ operations to control Unreal Engine 5. It works as an **MCP server** (for Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, and other MCP clients) or as a **standard CLI** (for Claude Code, shell scripts, CI/CD). It communicates with a C++ plugin (SoftUEBridge) running inside UE via HTTP/JSON-RPC, enabling actor spawning, Blueprint editing, material inspection, Play-In-Editor sessions, screenshot capture, performance profiling, and more.

### How do AI agents use soft-ue-cli?

**MCP clients** (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf): Connect via `soft-ue-cli mcp-serve`. The agent sees all 60+ tools with typed schemas and skill prompts — it can directly call UE operations without going through a terminal.

**Claude Code**: Runs soft-ue-cli commands in the terminal. Add a `CLAUDE.md` file to your UE project describing available commands, and Claude Code autonomously queries your level, spawns actors, edits Blueprints, runs PIE sessions, and iterates on your game.

### Can I use soft-ue-cli without an AI agent?

Yes. soft-ue-cli is a standard Python CLI. You can use it in shell scripts, CI/CD pipelines, custom automation tools, or any workflow that can invoke command-line programs. Every command outputs structured JSON, making it easy to parse and integrate.

### Does it work with packaged/cooked Unreal Engine builds?

Yes, in Development and DebugGame packaged builds by default. The bridge module now uses Unreal's `DeveloperTool` module type, so Shipping builds exclude it unless the target explicitly enables developer tools (for example via `bBuildDeveloperTools = true`).

The plugin descriptor restricts SoftUEBridge's editor-only dependency plugins to Editor targets, so Python/editor scripting dependencies are not enabled for packaged game targets.

### What Unreal Engine versions are supported?

soft-ue-cli is actively developed against Unreal Engine 5.7.

### Is there any runtime performance impact?

The SoftUEBridge plugin adds a lightweight HTTP server that listens on a single port. When no requests are being made, the overhead is negligible. The server processes requests on the game thread to ensure thread safety with UE APIs. Shipping builds exclude the bridge by default; if you intentionally need it there, enable developer tools for that target.

### How do I change the default port?

Set the `SOFT_UE_BRIDGE_PORT` environment variable before launching UE, or use the `--server` flag when running CLI commands. The default port is 8080.

### Can multiple UE instances run simultaneously?

Yes. Each UE instance writes its port to a `.soft-ue-bridge/instance.json` file in the project directory. Use `SOFT_UE_BRIDGE_URL` or `--server` to target a specific instance when multiple are running.

### How do I edit Blueprints from the command line?

Use `query-blueprint-graph` to inspect existing graph nodes, `add-graph-node` to create new nodes, `connect-graph-pins` to wire them together, and `remove-graph-node` to delete nodes. This enables fully programmatic Blueprint construction -- useful for AI-driven development and automated testing.

### What is the difference between soft-ue-cli and Unreal Engine Remote Control?

Unreal Engine's built-in Remote Control API focuses on property access and preset-based workflows. soft-ue-cli provides a broader command set specifically designed for AI coding agents -- including Blueprint graph editing, StateTree manipulation, PIE session control, UE Insights profiling, widget inspection, and asset creation -- with a simpler setup process (one pip install, one plugin copy).

### How do I use soft-ue-cli with Claude Desktop or Cursor?

Run `pip install soft-ue-cli[mcp]` to install MCP support, then add the server to your MCP client config. For Claude Desktop, add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "soft-ue-cli": {
      "command": "soft-ue-cli",
      "args": ["mcp-serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

The MCP server exposes all 60+ commands as MCP tools and skills as MCP prompts. The AI editor can then directly call UE operations without going through the terminal.

### What is the difference between soft-ue-cli and other UE MCP servers?

| | soft-ue-cli | unreal-mcp, ue5-mcp, etc. |
|---|---|---|
| **Tools** | 60+ | 10–49 |
| **Coverage** | Blueprints, materials, StateTrees, widgets, PIE, profiling, DataTables, CVars, Live Coding | Varies; most cover actors + basic assets |
| **LLM skill prompts** | Yes (MCP prompts + CLI) | No |
| **CLI mode** | Yes — shell scripts, CI/CD, Claude Code | MCP-only |
| **Setup** | `pip install soft-ue-cli[mcp]` + copy one plugin | Varies; often requires custom C++/Python scripting |
