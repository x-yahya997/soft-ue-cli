# Changelog

All notable changes to soft-ue-cli will be documented in this file.

## [1.25.3] - 2026-04-15

### Changed
- refreshed the public README badge strip to highlight AI agent support, shipped skills, tool count, MCP mode, and direct support links without implying the package is tied to a single client

## [1.25.2] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- `run-python-script` CLI tests now assert the shipped `script_path` dispatch behavior used by `--name` and `--script-path`, keeping the release smoke suite aligned with the actual bridge request payloads

## [1.25.1] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- `query-asset --asset-path /Game/...` world inspection now builds cleanly on UE 5.7 by switching to `FSoftObjectPath` asset lookups and including the concrete `AGameModeBase` definition needed by `WorldSettings.DefaultGameMode`

## [1.25.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- `query-asset --asset-path /Game/...` now exposes `world_settings.default_game_mode` and related map metadata for `UWorld` assets, so test maps can be checked offline for `WorldSettings` overrides
- new `plan-test-infrastructure` and `setup-test-infrastructure` skills centralize project-specific test-map/module convention work under the `author-test` workflow

### Fixed
- `run-python-script --script-path` now executes files as files again instead of flattening them into inline source, preserving `__file__`, `__future__` imports, and normal quoting/docstring behavior
- `run-python-script` now rejects editor map-loading APIs such as `EditorLoadingAndSavingUtils.load_map()` and `EditorLevelLibrary.load_level()` before execution to avoid tearing down the active Python context
- `inspect-anim-instance` now populates `slots` from active montage slot tracks instead of always returning an empty array
- `set-asset-property` property-path traversal now descends into `InstancedStruct` payloads, enabling nested edits for assets such as ChooserTables
- authoring skill templates now use `EAutomationTestFlags::EditorContext` and explicitly avoid bare `GetWorld()` calls from generated Automation Spec bodies for UE 5.7 compatibility

## [1.24.1] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- offline External Actor tagged property parsing now resolves combined `FName` references in property headers, so fields such as `DataLayerAssets` no longer fall back to `invalid_name_*` when the upper 32-bit name number is populated

## [1.24.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- `inspect-uasset --sections properties` and `diff-uasset --sections properties` now expose and diff External Actor tagged UPROPERTY payloads offline, including common scalar, object, array, and struct values when parsable
- README architecture and testing docs now use text diagrams and explicitly show the split between bridge-backed exploration flows and offline/local capabilities

### Changed
- test authoring skills now target committed C++ Automation Spec outputs; CLI + bridge + Python workflows are documented as exploration inputs rather than the final regression artifact
- `run-test` skill has been removed; execution guidance now belongs with the generated C++ test workflow rather than a generic skill

### Fixed
- `run-python-script --script-path` now resolves the file locally before dispatch, avoiding bridge-side path misinterpretation
- `run-python-script` now supports explicit world targeting and injects world helpers for editor/PIE/game execution
- `inspect-widget-blueprint` now surfaces referenced Input Mapping Context bindings and resolved keys for Input Action references
- SoftUEBridge now defaults to Unreal's `DeveloperTool` module type so Shipping builds exclude it by default
- `query-material` no longer risks an unbounded `GetInput()` iteration when inspecting material graphs

## [1.23.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- `rewind-start`, `rewind-stop`, `rewind-status` commands to control UE Rewind Debugger recording sessions with channel and actor filtering
- `rewind-list-tracks`, `rewind-overview`, `rewind-snapshot` commands for LLM-driven animation debugging ? list recorded actors, get track-level summaries, and drill down to animation state at a specific time or frame
- `rewind-save` command to persist in-memory recordings to `.utrace` files
- `inspect-uasset` / `diff-uasset` now support non-Blueprint assets (AnimSequence, PoseSearchDatabase, DataTable, etc.) via a generic export/import summary fallback
- `inspect-uasset` now extracts actor label/class/path, GUID, folder, runtime grid, tags, and data-layer hints from External Actor `.uasset` packages for offline history review
- `inspect-uasset --sections properties` and `diff-uasset --sections properties` now expose and diff External Actor tagged UPROPERTY payloads offline, including common scalar, object, array, and struct values when parsable

### Fixed
- `pie-tick` no longer crashes with a re-entrant TaskGraph assertion when UMassEntityEditorSubsystem (or any `FTickableEditorObject` that waits on game-thread tasks) is active. World ticks are now deferred through FTSTicker and driven by the engine's normal Slate tick loop instead of running directly inside the bridge server's AsyncTask handler.

### Notes
- Rewind Debugger commands require the **Animation Insights (GameplayInsights)** plugin to be enabled in Edit > Plugins. Error messages guide users to enable it when not active.
- README architecture docs now use text diagrams and explicitly show which commands bypass the bridge and operate on local files offline.

## [1.22.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- `batch-call` command for composing multiple bridge tool invocations into one in-process batch request
- `pie-tick` command for deterministic PIE stepping by frame count
- `inspect-anim-instance` command for one-shot snapshots of live anim state machines, montages, and blend weights
- `run-python-script` bridge helper import support via `from soft_ue_bridge import call`
- `replay-changes` skill for Git and Perforce binary-asset conflict recovery using manual `base/local/remote` extraction plus offline `.uasset` inspection

### Changed
- `call-function` now supports class-targeted invocation flows including class default object and transient-instance execution, plus batch JSON input
- `test-tools` now exercises the new automation surface for `batch-call`, `pie-tick`, `inspect-anim-instance`, and transient `call-function`
- `replay-changes` is now documented as a CLI skill workflow instead of a dedicated command

### Fixed
- `call-function` latent-function rejection now uses a portable `LatentActionInfo` struct-name check across engine versions
- `inspect-anim-instance` resolves state machine descriptors more reliably and avoids engine-version-specific transition query breakage during bridge builds
- public CLI export sync now hard-fails if embargoed private names appear in examples, docs, tests, prompts, or code

## [1.21.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- `query-enum` command for UserDefinedEnum introspection: authored names, display names, tooltips, and numeric values
- `query-struct` command for UserDefinedStruct introspection: authored member names, defaults, metadata, and reflected type info
- `blueprint-to-cpp` skill now starts with dependency-first planning guidance, including enum/struct inspection and promotion-first conversion strategy

### Fixed
- `query-asset --asset-path` now inspects `UserDefinedEnum` and `UserDefinedStruct` assets instead of failing with a generic load error
- `query-asset --asset-path` now inspects Blueprint-generated `UDataAsset` / `UPrimaryDataAsset` assets via their generated class default object
- `capture-screenshot tab --window-name ...` now falls back to visible tab labels and matching top-level window titles, so asset editor tabs opened by label can be captured more reliably

### Changed
- Removed the standalone `inspect-uasset` skill prompt; offline `.uasset` inspection remains available as a command and as part of `test-tools`

## [1.20.6] - 2026-04-10

### Changed
- Clarified `inspect-uasset` and `diff-uasset` help text, skill metadata, and README wording: they operate on local `.uasset` files offline, with best support currently for Blueprint assets rather than Blueprint-only support

## [1.20.5] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- `open-asset` no longer dereferences a stale `UWorld` pointer after `LoadLevel()`, fixing the access violation that could occur when loading World assets through the level editor path

## [1.20.4] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- `inspect-uasset` and `diff-uasset` now parse UE 5.4+ package headers (`LegacyFileVersion -8/-9`), so offline Blueprint inspection works on modern UE 5.4-5.7 assets instead of failing on the package summary

## [1.20.3] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- Public repo `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` are no longer stripped of newlines during sync, so the GitHub project page and PyPI description render correctly again (regression introduced in 1.20.0)

## [1.20.2] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- `get-config-value` and `validate-config-key` now share the same resolved section-entry lookup path, allowing bridge reads for keys such as `r.Bloom` that may not round-trip through `GConfig->GetString()`
- `test-tools` now validates `set-config-value` against the bridge tool's actual `{"status":"ok"}` response payload instead of expecting a nonexistent `success` field

### Changed
- `test-tools` now resolves offline `.uasset` paths from `get-project-info.project_directory` and the asset path created earlier in the run, so `inspect-uasset` and `diff-uasset` exercise the saved asset directly
- `test-tools` now seeds a project config key before running `config get --search`, so the offline config search path is exercised against known on-disk input

## [1.20.1] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- Bridge config tools now use public `FConfigCacheIni` section accessors instead of the unavailable `GetSectionPrivate()` helper, fixing UE builds that failed when compiling `get-config-value` and `validate-config-key`

### Changed
- `test-tools` skill now exercises the new config bridge tools and CLI config subcommands during live integration runs

## [1.20.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- Unified `config` command group for Unreal configuration inspection and editing: `config tree`, `config get`, `config set`, `config diff`, and `config audit`
- Offline config parsing and diff support for UE INI, `BuildConfiguration.xml`, and `.uproject` / `.uplugin` JSON files
- Runtime bridge config helpers: `get-config-value`, `set-config-value`, and `validate-config-key`

### Changed
- MCP now exposes the nested client-side `config` tool cleanly via schema extraction and command dispatch

## [1.19.0] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- `inspect-uasset` command for offline inspection of local Blueprint `.uasset` files without a running Unreal Editor
- `diff-uasset` command for offline file-to-file diff of extracted Blueprint metadata sections
- `inspect-uasset` skill for LLM workflows that need conservative offline package inspection

### Changed
- `test-tools` skill now exercises `inspect-uasset` and `diff-uasset` against a real on-disk Blueprint generated during the integration run

### Fixed
- Offline Blueprint summary extraction now resolves `parent_class_path` from the imported object's outer package chain instead of reporting incorrect `/Script/CoreUObject.*` paths for common engine parents
- Offline Blueprint summary extraction now parses `blueprint_type` instead of hardcoding `Normal`
- `inspect-uasset` now fails fast on non-Blueprint packages instead of returning a misleading successful `Unknown` summary

## [1.18.0] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- CLI argument validation: `capture-screenshot --region` and `add-graph-node --position` now fail with a clear comma-separated-integer error instead of surfacing a raw Python `ValueError`
- CLI argument validation: `query-mpc --value` now reports a friendly numeric/JSON parsing error for malformed scalar input instead of crashing with a raw `ValueError`

## [1.17.0] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- `report-bug` and `request-feature`: `gh auth token` lookup now times out cleanly instead of hanging indefinitely when GitHub CLI credentials are unavailable or blocked
- MCP schema: `set-property` now accepts any JSON value for `value`, matching the CLI and bridge behavior for scalar, array, and object payloads
- MCP server: `add-graph-node` now maps `--no-auto-position` correctly, surfaces normalized `node_guid` values for special node creation cases, and returns cleaner client-side command errors
- MCP server: `pie-session start` now forwards tool-level timeout to the HTTP request and attempts a best-effort stop after startup timeouts to avoid leaving PIE half-initialized
- `test-tools`: teardown now treats `delete-asset` reporting `Asset not found` as an idempotent success during cleanup, avoiding false failures after restore flows that already removed the temporary test asset
- `test-tools`: `insights-capture stop` now treats already-idle or auto-stopped traces as a pass in both CLI and MCP paths, avoiding false failures when trace state changes between status polling and stop
- `test-tools`: MCP all-mode now reads `mcp-serve` stdout as UTF-8 with replacement semantics, avoiding Windows `cp949` decode crashes on non-ASCII output
- `test-tools`: setup now retries the first `open-asset` call for a freshly created temporary World asset, reducing false setup failures while the editor finishes registering the new level
- `test-tools`: restore flow now saves the temporary test level before switching back, avoiding modal unsaved-level prompts that can block or crash automation
- `open-asset`: World assets now load through the level editor path with extra GC passes, reducing map-switch crashes and stale-world failures during automation
- `pie-session`: start/stop now return request-based transitional states instead of blocking the request thread while UE finishes entering or leaving PIE
- `insights-capture`: trace start now uses the documented filename-first console command form and stop/status treat already-idle traces consistently, reducing false stop failures in automation

## [1.16.0] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- Plugin: bridge HTTP listener dropped after PIE startup ? `USoftUEBridgeSubsystem` now registers a 10-second `FTSTicker` that calls `StartAllListeners()` to revive listeners silently stopped by PIE world initialization; subsequent bridge calls no longer fail with WinError 10054 after a PIE session
- `test-tools` skill: teardown script called `AssetEditorSubsystem.close_all_asset_editors()` which does not exist in UE 5.7 ? replaced with a `getattr` probe that tries `close_all_asset_editors` and `close_all_editors` in order; `SystemLibrary.collect_garbage()` now always runs regardless of whether an editor-close method is found

## [1.15.0] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- MCP: `set-console-var` rejected integer/float values ? MCP schema now declares `value` as `any` type so pydantic accepts strings, ints, and floats
- MCP: `batch-delete-actors` rejected list for `actors` field ? schema now declares `actors` as array type; same fix applied to `batch-spawn-actors.actors`, `batch-modify-actors.modifications`, `spawn-actor.location/rotation`, `add-graph-node.position`, and `set-node-position.positions`
- MCP: `capture-screenshot` required `mode` field ? schema now makes `mode` optional with default `"viewport"`
- MCP: `report-bug` hung indefinitely via MCP transport ? `gh auth token` subprocess was inheriting the MCP stdin pipe and blocking; fixed with `stdin=subprocess.DEVNULL`
- MCP: `test-tools --mode mcp` queue desync after client-side timeout ? `MCPClient._recv` now matches responses by ID, discarding stale responses from previous timed-out calls

## [1.14.0] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- `pie-session start` timed out after 30 s even when a longer timeout was requested ? the tool's server-side `WaitForPIEReady` has its own `timeout` argument (default 30 s); the test now passes it explicitly so PIE gets the full allotted time
- `open-asset` for World assets crashed the editor with "World Memory Leaks: 1 leaked objects" (triggered by Niagara holding a world reference during level switch) ? fatal error is now suppressed via a custom `FOutputDeviceError` device for the duration of `OpenEditorForAsset`, allowing the world switch to complete and Niagara to update its reference normally on the next tick
- `modify-interface`: interface class paths like `/Game/Path/BPI_Name` now resolve correctly; the tool tries the `_C`-suffixed class path and Blueprint `GeneratedClass` fallback when the initial load fails

### Added
- `test-tools` skill v2.0 ? `--mode cli` (default, direct HTTP), `--mode mcp` (via `mcp-serve` stdio), `--mode all` (runs both and combines report); MCP mode exercises the full MCP server layer without any LLM in the loop
- `call_tool()` now accepts an optional `timeout` parameter to override the per-request HTTP timeout (falls back to `SOFT_UE_BRIDGE_TIMEOUT` env var or 30 s)
- Plugin: Windows Structured Exception handling (SEH) in the bridge root ? unhandled C++ exceptions from tools are caught and returned as JSON-RPC errors instead of crashing the editor

## [1.13.0] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- `mcp-serve`: `report-bug` (and other client-side tools) crashed with `NameError: name 'io' is not defined` ? added missing `import io` to `mcp_server.py`
- `mcp-serve`: `query-asset` with `asset_class` filter returned 0 results ? MCP was forwarding the parameter as `asset_class` but the bridge expects `class`; added per-tool parameter rename mapping
- `capture-screenshot --mode window` failed via MCP with "No active editor window found" ? the editor is never the foreground window when an agent calls via mcp-serve; now uses `IMainFrameModule::GetParentWindow()` with fallback to the active window

### Added
- `create-asset` now supports `World` asset type ? create new levels from the CLI: `soft-ue-cli create-asset /Game/Maps/LV_New World`
- `create-asset --template PATH` ? duplicate an existing level instead of creating a blank one

## [1.12.0] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- `mcp-serve`: tool arguments were silently dropped ? MCP client now receives the correct JSON schema for every tool and arguments are forwarded to the bridge as expected
- `mcp-serve`: `class-hierarchy` and `project-info` routed to wrong bridge tool name, always returning "Unknown tool"
- `mcp-serve`: `status`, `check-setup`, `setup`, `report-bug`, `request-feature`, `submit-testimonial` returned "Unknown tool" because they are client-side operations; they now run their existing handlers directly and return output to the MCP client

### Changed
- `submit-testimonial` now posts via REST API instead of GitHub Discussions GraphQL

## [1.11.1] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- Architecture diagram missing on GitHub ? use relative path instead of absolute URL to private repo
- Python version badge showing "missing" on PyPI ? added Python 3.10?3.13 classifiers to pyproject.toml

## [1.11.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- `set-viewport-camera` command ? programmatically control the editor viewport camera with presets (top, bottom, front, back, left, right, perspective), custom location/rotation, and orthographic zoom
- `level-from-image` skill ? populate a UE level from a reference image using existing project assets, with autonomous visual feedback loop and human-in-the-loop refinement
- Batch actor tool reference section in level-from-image skill documentation

### Fixed
- Skills frontmatter parser now skips nested YAML lines, correctly displaying skill descriptions

## [1.10.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- `submit-testimonial` command ? share feedback via GitHub Discussions with auto-collected metadata (CLI version, usage streak, top tools), consent prompt before posting
- Bug report nudge ? unexpected errors now suggest filing a bug with a pre-filled `report-bug` command
- Daily usage streak tracking ? after 3+ consecutive days of use, a one-time testimonial nudge appears
- MCP server returns structured `bug_report_hint` and `testimonial_nudge` payloads for LLM agents
- GitHub Discussions integration via GraphQL API for testimonial posting

### Changed
- `call_tool()` now raises `BridgeError` with error classification (expected vs unexpected) instead of calling `sys.exit(1)` directly ? enables richer error handling downstream

## [1.9.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- `mcp-serve` command ? run soft-ue-cli as an MCP server over stdio, exposing 60+ commands as MCP tools and skills as MCP prompts
- Compatible with Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and other MCP clients
- Install with: `pip install soft-ue-cli[mcp]`

## [1.8.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- `skills list` command ? discover LLM workflow prompts shipped with the CLI
- `skills get <name>` command ? retrieve a skill's full content for LLM consumption
- `blueprint-to-cpp` skill ? instructs an LLM to generate C++ `.h`/`.cpp` from Blueprint assets using Layer 1 (class scaffolding) and Layer 2 (graph logic translation with 100+ node type mappings)

### Fixed
- `compile-material` now uses `GMaxRHIShaderPlatform` instead of deprecated `GMaxRHIFeatureLevel` (UE 5.7 compatibility)

## [1.7.1] - 2026-04-02

### Fixed
- `query-level --class-filter` now matches inherited classes (e.g. `--class-filter Character` finds all Character subclasses)

## [1.7.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- `compile-material` command ? trigger recompilation of Material, MaterialInstance, or MaterialFunction assets from the CLI
- MSYS/Git Bash path mangling detection ? automatically reverses `/Game/` → `C:/Program Files/Git/Game/` conversion for asset paths

### Fixed
- `get-logs` and all output commands no longer crash with `UnicodeEncodeError` on Korean Windows (cp949 locale)

## [1.6.2] - 2026-03-29

### Added
- `query-material` now supports MaterialFunction assets ? inspect expression graphs inside material functions

## [1.6.1] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed

- `query-level --include-foliage` ? list FoliageType instances with counts from InstancedFoliageActors
- `query-level --include-grass` ? list LandscapeProxy actors with component counts and materials
- `create-asset AnimLayerInterface` (or `ALI`) ? creates a Blueprint-compatible AnimLayerInterface using BPTYPE_Interface factory
- `query-asset` structured output for `ULandscapeGrassType` ? parses GrassVarieties into per-variety JSON with mesh, density, culling, scaling fields

### Fixed
- `add-graph-node --properties '{"Layer":"X"}'` now correctly configures LinkedAnimLayer nodes by setting Interface and Layer on the inner FAnimNode struct and reconstructing pins
- `add-graph-node --properties '{"Alpha":0.08}'` now sets pin default values (Alpha, BlendWeight, etc.) when properties aren't found via reflection
- `create-asset` phantom registry deadlock resolved ? force-rescans the package path to clear stale entries before creation

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- `save-asset` command ? save modified assets to disk after mutations, preventing data loss from editor crashes
- `compile-blueprint` command ? trigger Blueprint/AnimBlueprint compilation and return status (success, warnings, errors)
- `insert-graph-node` command ? atomically insert a new node between two connected nodes with auto pin detection, single undo transaction, and rollback on failure
- `disconnect-graph-pin --target-node --target-pin` ? disconnect a specific pin-to-pin connection while preserving other wires (without these flags, existing break-all behavior is unchanged)

- `query-level --include-properties` ? inspect actor and component property values with optional `--property-filter` wildcard filtering
- `create-asset --skeleton` ? dedicated flag for specifying skeleton asset path when creating AnimBlueprints
- `query-blueprint-graph` now returns interface implementation graphs (type `"interface"`) in addition to event, function, and macro graphs

### Fixed
- Phantom asset handling: `create-asset` and `delete-asset` now correctly detect and clean up phantom assets (registry entry with no loadable object)
- `modify-interface add` now auto-generates anim layer function graphs with Root and LinkedInputPose nodes when adding AnimLayerInterface to AnimBlueprints
- `add-graph-node` properties now correctly resolve through inner `Node` struct for animation graph nodes (e.g. AnimGraphNode_SpringBone BoneToModify, SpringStiffness)
- `add-graph-node` now returns `property_warnings` in JSON response instead of silently ignoring invalid properties
- `add-graph-node AnimGraphNode_LinkedAnimLayer` no longer crashes; pins are reconstructed after properties are set

## [1.3.2] - 2026-03-23

### Changed
- Updated supported UE version to 5.7 (active development target)

## [1.3.1] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- Plugin now auto-dismisses blocking UE editor dialogs during bridge tool execution, preventing game thread hangs and timeouts
- CLI timeout error message now hints at modal dialogs as a possible cause

### Improved

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-22

### Changed

### Added
- `build-and-relaunch --wait` ? monitors build progress, waits for the editor to come back up, and returns build result with duration. On failure, returns compiler errors directly.
