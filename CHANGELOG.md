# Changelog

All notable changes to soft-ue-cli will be documented in this file.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-22

### Changed
- `trigger-live-coding` now waits for compilation by default and returns the actual result (success, failure, cancelled). Use `--no-wait` for fire-and-forget.

### Added
- `build-and-relaunch --wait` — monitors build progress, waits for the editor to come back up, and returns build result with duration. On failure, returns compiler errors directly.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- `inspect-runtime-widgets` command — inspect live UMG widget geometry during PIE sessions
  - Query by widget name or class with keyword search
  - Returns computed geometry (absolute position, local size, accumulated render transform)
  - Includes slot properties and render settings
  - Optional `--include-slate` flag for underlying Slate widget data
  - Supports multiple PIE instances via `--pie-index`

## [1.1.1] - 2026-03-19

- `add-graph-node AnimLayerFunction` — create anim layer function graphs on AnimLayerInterface assets with Root and Input Pose nodes

### Fixed
