# Changelog

All notable changes to soft-ue-cli will be documented in this file.

## [1.20.5] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- `open-asset` no longer dereferences a stale `UWorld` pointer after `LoadLevel()`, fixing the access violation that could occur when loading World assets through the level editor path

## [1.20.4] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- `inspect-uasset` and `diff-uasset` now parse UE 5.4+ package headers (`LegacyFileVersion -8/-9`), so offline Blueprint inspection works on modern UE 5.4-5.7 assets instead of failing on the package summary

## [1.20.3] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- Public repo `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` are no longer stripped of newlines during sync, so the GitHub project page and PyPI description render correctly again (regression introduced in 1.20.0)

## [1.20.2] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- `get-config-value` and `validate-config-key` now share the same resolved section-entry lookup path, allowing bridge reads for keys such as `r.Bloom` that may not round-trip through `GConfig->GetString()`
- `test-tools` now validates `set-config-value` against the bridge tool's actual `{"status":"ok"}` response payload instead of expecting a nonexistent `success` field

### Changed
- `test-tools` now resolves offline `.uasset` paths from `get-project-info.project_directory` and the asset path created earlier in the run, so `inspect-uasset` and `diff-uasset` exercise the saved asset directly
- `test-tools` now seeds a project config key before running `config get --search`, so the offline config search path is exercised against known on-disk input

## [1.20.1] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- Bridge config tools now use public `FConfigCacheIni` section accessors instead of the unavailable `GetSectionPrivate()` helper, fixing UE builds that failed when compiling `get-config-value` and `validate-config-key`

### Changed
- `test-tools` skill now exercises the new config bridge tools and CLI config subcommands during live integration runs

## [1.20.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- Unified `config` command group for Unreal configuration inspection and editing: `config tree`, `config get`, `config set`, `config diff`, and `config audit`
- Offline config parsing and diff support for UE INI, `BuildConfiguration.xml`, and `.uproject` / `.uplugin` JSON files
- Runtime bridge config helpers: `get-config-value`, `set-config-value`, and `validate-config-key`

### Changed
- MCP now exposes the nested client-side `config` tool cleanly via schema extraction and command dispatch

## [1.19.0] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- `inspect-uasset` command for offline inspection of local Blueprint `.uasset` files without a running Unreal Editor
- `diff-uasset` command for offline file-to-file diff of extracted Blueprint metadata sections
- `inspect-uasset` skill for LLM workflows that need conservative offline package inspection

### Changed
- `test-tools` skill now exercises `inspect-uasset` and `diff-uasset` against a real on-disk Blueprint generated during the integration run

### Fixed
- Offline Blueprint summary extraction now resolves `parent_class_path` from the imported object's outer package chain instead of reporting incorrect `/Script/CoreUObject.*` paths for common engine parents
- Offline Blueprint summary extraction now parses `blueprint_type` instead of hardcoding `Normal`
- `inspect-uasset` now fails fast on non-Blueprint packages instead of returning a misleading successful `Unknown` summary

## [1.18.0] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- CLI argument validation: `capture-screenshot --region` and `add-graph-node --position` now fail with a clear comma-separated-integer error instead of surfacing a raw Python `ValueError`
- CLI argument validation: `query-mpc --value` now reports a friendly numeric/JSON parsing error for malformed scalar input instead of crashing with a raw `ValueError`

## [1.17.0] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- `report-bug` and `request-feature`: `gh auth token` lookup now times out cleanly instead of hanging indefinitely when GitHub CLI credentials are unavailable or blocked
- MCP schema: `set-property` now accepts any JSON value for `value`, matching the CLI and bridge behavior for scalar, array, and object payloads
- MCP server: `add-graph-node` now maps `--no-auto-position` correctly, surfaces normalized `node_guid` values for special node creation cases, and returns cleaner client-side command errors
- MCP server: `pie-session start` now forwards tool-level timeout to the HTTP request and attempts a best-effort stop after startup timeouts to avoid leaving PIE half-initialized
- `test-tools`: teardown now treats `delete-asset` reporting `Asset not found` as an idempotent success during cleanup, avoiding false failures after restore flows that already removed the temporary test asset
- `test-tools`: `insights-capture stop` now treats already-idle or auto-stopped traces as a pass in both CLI and MCP paths, avoiding false failures when trace state changes between status polling and stop
- `test-tools`: MCP all-mode now reads `mcp-serve` stdout as UTF-8 with replacement semantics, avoiding Windows `cp949` decode crashes on non-ASCII output
- `test-tools`: setup now retries the first `open-asset` call for a freshly created temporary World asset, reducing false setup failures while the editor finishes registering the new level
- `test-tools`: restore flow now saves the temporary test level before switching back, avoiding modal unsaved-level prompts that can block or crash automation
- `open-asset`: World assets now load through the level editor path with extra GC passes, reducing map-switch crashes and stale-world failures during automation
- `pie-session`: start/stop now return request-based transitional states instead of blocking the request thread while UE finishes entering or leaving PIE
- `insights-capture`: trace start now uses the documented filename-first console command form and stop/status treat already-idle traces consistently, reducing false stop failures in automation

## [1.16.0] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- Plugin: bridge HTTP listener dropped after PIE startup — `USoftUEBridgeSubsystem` now registers a 10-second `FTSTicker` that calls `StartAllListeners()` to revive listeners silently stopped by PIE world initialization; subsequent bridge calls no longer fail with WinError 10054 after a PIE session
- `test-tools` skill: teardown script called `AssetEditorSubsystem.close_all_asset_editors()` which does not exist in UE 5.7 — replaced with a `getattr` probe that tries `close_all_asset_editors` and `close_all_editors` in order; `SystemLibrary.collect_garbage()` now always runs regardless of whether an editor-close method is found

## [1.15.0] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- MCP: `set-console-var` rejected integer/float values — MCP schema now declares `value` as `any` type so pydantic accepts strings, ints, and floats
- MCP: `batch-delete-actors` rejected list for `actors` field — schema now declares `actors` as array type; same fix applied to `batch-spawn-actors.actors`, `batch-modify-actors.modifications`, `spawn-actor.location/rotation`, `add-graph-node.position`, and `set-node-position.positions`
- MCP: `capture-screenshot` required `mode` field — schema now makes `mode` optional with default `"viewport"`
- MCP: `report-bug` hung indefinitely via MCP transport — `gh auth token` subprocess was inheriting the MCP stdin pipe and blocking; fixed with `stdin=subprocess.DEVNULL`
- MCP: `test-tools --mode mcp` queue desync after client-side timeout — `MCPClient._recv` now matches responses by ID, discarding stale responses from previous timed-out calls

## [1.14.0] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- `pie-session start` timed out after 30 s even when a longer timeout was requested — the tool's server-side `WaitForPIEReady` has its own `timeout` argument (default 30 s); the test now passes it explicitly so PIE gets the full allotted time
- `open-asset` for World assets crashed the editor with "World Memory Leaks: 1 leaked objects" (triggered by Niagara holding a world reference during level switch) — fatal error is now suppressed via a custom `FOutputDeviceError` device for the duration of `OpenEditorForAsset`, allowing the world switch to complete and Niagara to update its reference normally on the next tick
- `modify-interface`: interface class paths like `/Game/Path/BPI_Name` now resolve correctly; the tool tries the `_C`-suffixed class path and Blueprint `GeneratedClass` fallback when the initial load fails

### Added
- `test-tools` skill v2.0 — `--mode cli` (default, direct HTTP), `--mode mcp` (via `mcp-serve` stdio), `--mode all` (runs both and combines report); MCP mode exercises the full MCP server layer without any LLM in the loop
- `call_tool()` now accepts an optional `timeout` parameter to override the per-request HTTP timeout (falls back to `SOFT_UE_BRIDGE_TIMEOUT` env var or 30 s)
- Plugin: Windows Structured Exception handling (SEH) in the bridge root — unhandled C++ exceptions from tools are caught and returned as JSON-RPC errors instead of crashing the editor

## [1.13.0] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- `mcp-serve`: `report-bug` (and other client-side tools) crashed with `NameError: name 'io' is not defined` — added missing `import io` to `mcp_server.py`
- `mcp-serve`: `query-asset` with `asset_class` filter returned 0 results — MCP was forwarding the parameter as `asset_class` but the bridge expects `class`; added per-tool parameter rename mapping
- `capture-screenshot --mode window` failed via MCP with "No active editor window found" — the editor is never the foreground window when an agent calls via mcp-serve; now uses `IMainFrameModule::GetParentWindow()` with fallback to the active window

### Added
- `create-asset` now supports `World` asset type — create new levels from the CLI: `soft-ue-cli create-asset /Game/Maps/LV_New World`
- `create-asset --template PATH` — duplicate an existing level instead of creating a blank one

## [1.12.0] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- `mcp-serve`: tool arguments were silently dropped — MCP client now receives the correct JSON schema for every tool and arguments are forwarded to the bridge as expected
- `mcp-serve`: `class-hierarchy` and `project-info` routed to wrong bridge tool name, always returning "Unknown tool"
- `mcp-serve`: `status`, `check-setup`, `setup`, `report-bug`, `request-feature`, `submit-testimonial` returned "Unknown tool" because they are client-side operations; they now run their existing handlers directly and return output to the MCP client

### Changed
- `submit-testimonial` now posts via REST API instead of GitHub Discussions GraphQL

## [1.11.1] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- Architecture diagram missing on GitHub — use relative path instead of absolute URL to private repo
- Python version badge showing "missing" on PyPI — added Python 3.10–3.13 classifiers to pyproject.toml

## [1.11.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- `set-viewport-camera` command — programmatically control the editor viewport camera with presets (top, bottom, front, back, left, right, perspective), custom location/rotation, and orthographic zoom
- `level-from-image` skill — populate a UE level from a reference image using existing project assets, with autonomous visual feedback loop and human-in-the-loop refinement
- Batch actor tool reference section in level-from-image skill documentation

### Fixed
- Skills frontmatter parser now skips nested YAML lines, correctly displaying skill descriptions

## [1.10.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- `submit-testimonial` command — share feedback via GitHub Discussions with auto-collected metadata (CLI version, usage streak, top tools), consent prompt before posting
- Bug report nudge — unexpected errors now suggest filing a bug with a pre-filled `report-bug` command
- Daily usage streak tracking — after 3+ consecutive days of use, a one-time testimonial nudge appears
- MCP server returns structured `bug_report_hint` and `testimonial_nudge` payloads for LLM agents
- GitHub Discussions integration via GraphQL API for testimonial posting

### Changed
- `call_tool()` now raises `BridgeError` with error classification (expected vs unexpected) instead of calling `sys.exit(1)` directly — enables richer error handling downstream

## [1.9.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- `mcp-serve` command — run soft-ue-cli as an MCP server over stdio, exposing 60+ commands as MCP tools and skills as MCP prompts
- Compatible with Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and other MCP clients
- Install with: `pip install soft-ue-cli[mcp]`

## [1.8.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- `skills list` command — discover LLM workflow prompts shipped with the CLI
- `skills get <name>` command — retrieve a skill's full content for LLM consumption
- `blueprint-to-cpp` skill — instructs an LLM to generate C++ `.h`/`.cpp` from Blueprint assets using Layer 1 (class scaffolding) and Layer 2 (graph logic translation with 100+ node type mappings)

### Fixed
- `compile-material` now uses `GMaxRHIShaderPlatform` instead of deprecated `GMaxRHIFeatureLevel` (UE 5.7 compatibility)

## [1.7.1] - 2026-04-02

### Fixed
- `query-level --class-filter` now matches inherited classes (e.g. `--class-filter Character` finds all Character subclasses)

## [1.7.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- `compile-material` command — trigger recompilation of Material, MaterialInstance, or MaterialFunction assets from the CLI
- MSYS/Git Bash path mangling detection — automatically reverses `/Game/` → `C:/Program Files/Git/Game/` conversion for asset paths

### Fixed
- `get-logs` and all output commands no longer crash with `UnicodeEncodeError` on Korean Windows (cp949 locale)

## [1.6.2] - 2026-03-29

### Added
- `query-material` now supports MaterialFunction assets — inspect expression graphs inside material functions

## [1.6.1] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- `create-asset AnimBlueprint --skeleton` now correctly creates an AnimBlueprint instead of a generic Actor Blueprint (subclass routing order fix)

- `query-mpc` command — read and write Material Parameter Collection scalar/vector values (both default and runtime)
- `save-asset --checkout` — auto-checkout from source control (Perforce, etc.) before saving
- `query-material --parent-chain` — walk full MaterialInstance inheritance chain from leaf to root Material
- `query-level --include-foliage` — list FoliageType instances with counts from InstancedFoliageActors
- `query-level --include-grass` — list LandscapeProxy actors with component counts and materials
- `create-asset AnimLayerInterface` (or `ALI`) — creates a Blueprint-compatible AnimLayerInterface using BPTYPE_Interface factory
- `query-asset` structured output for `ULandscapeGrassType` — parses GrassVarieties into per-variety JSON with mesh, density, culling, scaling fields

### Fixed
- `add-graph-node --properties '{"Layer":"X"}'` now correctly configures LinkedAnimLayer nodes by setting Interface and Layer on the inner FAnimNode struct and reconstructing pins
- `add-graph-node --properties '{"Alpha":0.08}'` now sets pin default values (Alpha, BlendWeight, etc.) when properties aren't found via reflection
- `create-asset` phantom registry deadlock resolved — force-rescans the package path to clear stale entries before creation

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- `save-asset` command — save modified assets to disk after mutations, preventing data loss from editor crashes

- `query-level --include-properties` — inspect actor and component property values with optional `--property-filter` wildcard filtering
- `create-asset --skeleton` — dedicated flag for specifying skeleton asset path when creating AnimBlueprints
- `query-blueprint-graph` now returns interface implementation graphs (type `"interface"`) in addition to event, function, and macro graphs

### Fixed

- `modify-interface add` now auto-generates anim layer function graphs with Root and LinkedInputPose nodes when adding AnimLayerInterface to AnimBlueprints
- `add-graph-node` properties now correctly resolve through inner `Node` struct for animation graph nodes (e.g. AnimGraphNode_SpringBone BoneToModify, SpringStiffness)
- `add-graph-node` now returns `property_warnings` in JSON response instead of silently ignoring invalid properties
- `add-graph-node AnimGraphNode_LinkedAnimLayer` no longer crashes; pins are reconstructed after properties are set

### Changed
- Updated supported UE version to 5.7 (active development target)

## [1.3.1] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- `build-and-relaunch --wait` — monitors build progress, waits for the editor to come back up, and returns build result with duration. On failure, returns compiler errors directly.
